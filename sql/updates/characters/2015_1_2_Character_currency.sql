-- some  of server it might need  clean table or run this query 
-- UPDATE  character_currency SET week_cap=0;
-- but  i warning you this makes  characters  with 0 honor to start from 0 because if remain with thoose numbers it will still be error

-- You Need Only Updates ? Ok So Do these lines Carefully
-- ALTER TABLE `character_currency` DROP COLUMN `new_cap`;
-- ALTER TABLE `character_currency` ADD COLUMN `season_count` INT(11) UNSIGNED NOT NULL AFTER `total_count`;
-- Also For Currect Work U Should Change the Order in This Way :   1-guid  2-currency  3-week_count  4-total_count  5-season_count

-- *Guide*
-- Add Character_currency.sql & character_currency_week_cap.sql at Character Database 
-- For test it u can use these commends in Game
-- Valor : .mod curr 396 x
-- Justic : .mod curr 395 x
-- Honor : .mod curr 392 x
-- Conquest :  .mod curr 396 x
