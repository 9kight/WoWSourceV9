1. The other problem is boss Lord Rhyolith http://www.wowhead.com/npc=52558/lord-rhyolith  who make the world freeze right now after you fight a litle  with him and you cant do nothing  when freeze comes but no crash 

2. in isle of conquest we  have a problem
   when you go bellow the ships
   down and capture the flag
   in 2 minutes you have the flag for your  faction and appear portal to ship but when you take the portal he teleport you WRONG and you die  and it  happens  because the coordonates  for teleport are wrong  not to the ships its some where  very far away  and  wrong
   i dont know if the coordonates are in the data base or c++ scripts
   when teleport will work then its all ok  in that  bg
   and yeah quest sacrificies its a trash because of that crash

3. Westfall Questline works 99% now only 2 quest that im busy working on (Rise of the Brotherhood)http://www.wowhead.com/quest=26322 and (A Vision of the Past)http://www.wowhead.com/quest=26320 for this quest we need sniff.
