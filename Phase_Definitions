phase_definitions Table

[Assignment]

`zoneId`
=================
The zoneId represents the zoneId from the zone where the definition is valid.
Only definitions are applied to the player if the current zoneid of the player is the same as in the phase definition.

That means:
- Deepholm definitions must have the zoneId: 5042
- Mount Hyjal definitions must have the zoneId: 616

`entry`
=================
Entrys are unique per zoneId.
Phase Definitions are applied in the order lowest entry -> highest entry.

It is important that you use higher entrys for later phases than lower phases, because
if you don't, you will loose the possibility to realize complex phasing dependent on huge quest chains.

[Conditions]

If the conditions of the phase definition fits to the player, the phasemask, terrainswap and phaseid will be applied/ send
to the player.

Condition Structure:

ConditionSourceType : CONDITION_SOURCE_TYPE_PHASE_DEFINITION (25)
SourceGroup : Is the zoneId of the phase definition.
SourceEntry : Is the entry of the phase deinition.

Currently you can only use following condition types:

- CONDITION_QUESTREWARDED(8)
- CONDITION_QUESTTAKEN(9)
- CONDITION_QUEST_COMPLETE(28)
- CONDITION_QUEST_NONE(14)
- CONDITION_TEAM(6)
- CONDITION_CLASS(15)
- CONDITION_RACE(16)
- CONDITION_INSTANCE_INFO(13)
- CONDITION_LEVEL(27)

The system supports dynamically recalculation on quest status or level change.

[Phasing]

`phasemask`
=================
If the phase definition fits to the player the phasemask is added to the player (bitmask addition - current_phasemask |= phasemask).

`terrainswapmap`
=================
Usually taken from sniffs, represents the map from where the client takes some map tiles and shows it in the current view.
For example map: 719 (Mount Hyjal burned default terrainswap).

If you want to overwrite an existing terrainswap use the flag 1 (explained later) and the default map (1 - Kalimdor to reset the Mount Hyjal terrainswap).

`phaseId`
=================
Usually taken from sniffs and 'phase.dbc', is sent to the client.

[Extended Phasing - Flags]

Now you should be able to write simple phase definitions.

But you can use flags to make the phasing more complex.

`flags`
=================

This flags are helping you to disable some phase definitions without using "negated conditions".

We are looking at a short example:

__________________________________________________
This is a small Questchain with 2 phasmasks 2, 4
And we want to show the player 2 different npcs after each quest at the same place. (2 -> 25362, 4 -> 27236)

Our creature Insert would look like this:

INSERT INTO `creature` (`guid`, `id`, `map`, `spawnMask`, `phaseMask`, `position_x`, `position_y`, `position_z`) VALUES
(guid+1, 25362, map, spawnMask, 2 /*phasemask*/, x, y, z), // will be visible if you have the quest rewarded: 12345
(guid+2, 27236, map, spawnMask, 4 /*phasemask*/, x, y, z); // will be visible if you have the quest rewarded: 54321

Quest 12345
|
V
Quest 54321

The zone in which we like to phase is the "Kelp'Thar Forest" subzone in vashj'ir, that means we have to use its zone id (4815).
You can find out the zoneId by using the .gps command.

The phase_definition table has no entry for the zone 4815 so we are using the entrys 1-3.
We start with the quest that you accept first: 25362.

If you get the quest 25362 rewarded you will be automatically phased into phasemask 2 to see the npc 25362 (guid+1).

Our Definition looks like this:
INSERT INTO `phase_definitions` (`zoneId`, `entry`, `phasemask`, `phaseId`, `terrainswapmap`, `flags`, `comment`) VALUES
(4815, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 'Example phasemask 2 to see npc 25362');

zoneId -> Kelp'Thar Forest (4815)
entry -> because it is the first definition
phasemask -> 2
phaseId -> 0 (we need no phase id)
terrainswapmap -> (we don't want any terrainswap. Theres no terrainswap available for vashjir too).
flags -> 0

If you test this definition without a condition linked to this you will be automatically phased into phasemask 2,
because the definition is active by default.

A simple quest rewarded condition linked to our phase definition will look like this:

INSERT INTO `conditions` (`SourceTypeOrReferenceId`, `SourceGroup`, `SourceEntry`, `SourceId`, `ElseGroup`, `ConditionTypeOrReference`, `ConditionTarget`, `ConditionValue1`, `ConditionValue2`, `ConditionValue3`, `NegativeCondition`, `ErrorTextId`, `ScriptName`, `Comment`) VALUES
(23, -- CONDITION_SOURCE_TYPE_PHASE_DEFINITION has source type 23
4815, -- This is the zone of the linked definition -> Kelp'Thar Forest (4815)
1, -- This is the entry of the linked definition
0, 0, 8, 0, 12345, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', ''); -- This is the rest of a simple quest rewarded condition.

Phase Definition for Quest: 54321
==================================
INSERT INTO `phase_definitions` (`zoneId`, `entry`, `phasemask`, `phaseId`, `terrainswapmap`, `flags`, `comment`) VALUES
(4815, 2, 4, 0, 0, 1, 'Example phasemask 4 to see npc 54321');

INSERT INTO `conditions` (`SourceTypeOrReferenceId`, `SourceGroup`, `SourceEntry`, `SourceId`, `ElseGroup`, `ConditionTypeOrReference`, `ConditionTarget`, `ConditionValue1`, `ConditionValue2`, `ConditionValue3`, `NegativeCondition`, `ErrorTextId`, `ScriptName`, `Comment`) VALUES
(23, 4815, 2, 0, 0, 8, 0, 54321, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '');

This looks like the same as in above example with modified questid, entry and phasemask with one exeption:

The flag column is not 0!

Now you will learn to use another feature of the system: flags.

Flags are used to define in which way phasemasks are added to the players phase if the phase condition fits to the player and how the phase is
calculated further.

You have to mention: Every phasemask is added from the lowest entry to the hightest entry.

That means if you define following definitions...

Entry 3, Phasemask 1, Flags 0
Entry 1, Phasemask 8, Flags 0
Entry 2, Phasemask 2, Flags 0

the PhaseMgr would add it like this...

| Entry 1, Phasemask 8, Flags 0
|.. 8
| Entry 2, Phasemask 2, Flags 0
|.. 10
| Entry 3, Phasemask 1, Flags 0
V.. 11
-----------------------------------
Phasemask: 8|2|1 = 11
__________________________________________
-> PHASE_FLAG_OVERWRITE_EXISTING = 0x1 (1)

If you define PHASE_FLAG_OVERWRITE_EXISTING the phase definition sets the current phasemask to 0.
After this the phasemask of the definition is added

Example:

Entry 1, Phasemask 8, Flags 0
Entry 2, Phasemask 16, Flags 0
Entry 3, Phasemask 2, Flags 1
Entry 4, Phasemask 1, Flags 0

| Entry 1, Phasemask 8, Flags 0
|.. 8
| Entry 2, Phasemask 16, Flags 0
|.. 24
|-> Set to 0
| Entry 3, Phasemask 2, Flags 1
|.. 2
| Entry 4, Phasemask 1, Flags 0
V.. 3
-----------------------------------
Phasemask: 2|1 = 3
__________________________________________
-> PHASE_FLAG_NO_MORE_PHASES = 0x2 (2)

If you define PHASE_FLAG_NO_MORE_PHASES the phasemgr will abort the phase calculation after the definition was added.

Example:

Entry 1, Phasemask 8, Flags 2
Entry 2, Phasemask 2, Flags 0
Entry 3, Phasemask 1, Flags 0

| Entry 1, Phasemask 8, Flags 2
|.. 8
|-> Abort

-----------------------------------
Phasemask: 8 = 8

__________________________________________
-> PHASE_FLAG_NEGATE_PHASE = 0x4 (3)

If you define PHASE_FLAG_NEGATE_PHASE the phasemgr will negate instead to add the phasemask.

Entry 1, Phasemask 10, Flags 0
Entry 2, Phasemask 2, Flags 4
Entry 3, Phasemask 1, Flags 0

| Entry 1, Phasemask 10, Flags 0
|.. 10
| Entry 2, Phasemask 2, Flags 4
|.. 8 (10 &~ 2 or in this case 10 - 2)
| Entry 3, Phasemask 1, Flags 0
V.. 9
-----------------------------------
Phasemask: (10 &~ 2) | 1 = 9
